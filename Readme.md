# Spark Churn Analysis Project

ðŸš€ Welcome to my Spark churn analysis project repository! ðŸ“Š

This repository contains my implementation of a churn analysis project using Apache Spark. Leveraging Spark's distributed computing capabilities, I've explored a telecommunications dataset to understand customer churn behavior. 

## Key Components

- Data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values and categorical encoding.
- Visualizations illustrating relationships between important features like tenure and total charges.
- Churn distribution analysis.
- Frequent itemset mining.
- Building predictive models using Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) from Spark's MLlib.

## Visualizations

Check out the insightful visualizations included in this project:

- **Tenure vs Total Charges Relationship**: Explore the correlation between tenure (months) and total charges ($) using a scatter plot.

- **Churn Count Distribution**: Understand the distribution of churn among customers using a bar chart.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics like accuracy and area under the ROC curve are used to assess model performance. This project showcases the power of Spark for scalable data analysis and machine learning tasks, making it a valuable resource for understanding and implementing churn analysis workflows. ðŸŒŸ
